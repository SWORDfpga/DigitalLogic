  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.

Section 3 - Informational

INFO:Security:54 - 'xc7k160t' is a WebPack part.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   9 block(s) removed
   7 block(s) optimized away
   5 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Loadless block "M/A0/XLXI_5" (OR) removed.
 The signal "M/A0/XLXN_10" is loadless and has been removed.
  Loadless block "M/A0/XLXI_3" (AND) removed.
Loadless block "M/A1/XLXI_5" (OR) removed.
 The signal "M/A1/XLXN_10" is loadless and has been removed.
  Loadless block "M/A1/XLXI_3" (AND) removed.
Loadless block "M/A2/XLXI_5" (OR) removed.
 The signal "M/A2/XLXN_10" is loadless and has been removed.
  Loadless block "M/A2/XLXI_3" (AND) removed.
Loadless block "M/A3/XLXI_5" (OR) removed.
 The signal "M/A3/XLXN_10" is loadless and has been removed.
  Loadless block "M/A3/XLXI_3" (AND) removed.

The trimmed logic reported below is either:
   1. part of a cycle
   2. part of disabled logic
   3. a side-effect of other trimmed logic

The signal "XLXN_3" is unused and has been removed.
 Unused block "M/CLA0/XLXI_22" (AND) removed.

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
AND2 		M/CLA0/XLXI_1
AND4 		M/CLA0/XLXI_20
AND3 		M/CLA0/XLXI_5
AND2 		XLXI_3
BUF 		XLXI_41
VCC 		XLXI_42
GND 		XST_GND

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
